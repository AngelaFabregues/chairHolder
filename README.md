# chairHolder

We have got a Stoke like chair from BBY that is foldable using plastic pieces. This project is about the design of the plastic pieces that have been broken.

We design the replacements using Open Scad. Then we print the pieces with one of our Prusa IT3 3D printers.

Long life to cheap and easy to break objects too.
